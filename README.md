Hi everyone!
My name is Kiley and I am going to be a senior at BSU this fall. I am from Bend, Oregon but have loved living in Boise the past few years.
I am majoring in Media Arts with an emphasis in Production and I am minoring in Computer Science. I can't wait to graduate and start my own journey!
